overview = "Brigadas de Liberación Nacional (National Liberation Brigades) is a rebel faction loosely based on latin-american guerrillas, including female combatants and a very basic initial default loadout, strictly based on civil hunting weapons. There's two scoped rifles in the arsenal, use them wisely to get semi-automatic weapons, smgs, launchers and grenades, because you have none of these at start. <br/> <br/> If you want a faster start, choose Standard, Western backed, or Eastern Backed versions. <br/> <br/> By Catertico. <br/> <br/> If you like this mod, consider supporting the author";
